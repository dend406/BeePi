# Заголовок 1 Smart bee hive "Bee-Pi"

The research is aimed at creating and implementing a smart beehive project based on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer. The use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and sensors will not only ensure monitoring of the state of beekeeping, but also make it more efficient, safer and focused on long-term sustainability.

The code for integrating the Blynk platform and sending information from sensors to it in file **Detect_Blynk.py**.

Insect detection and recognition takes place here **bee_video_capture final+servo.py**. If a wasp or hornet is detected, the servo closes the flight path. 

The code was developed here **bee_video_capture finally.py**.
